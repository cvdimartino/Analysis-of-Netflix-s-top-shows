# Netflix analysis of the Top Ten shows
This is the final project for the Data Managment and Visualization course at University of Milano-Bicocca (Data Science course). 
Its aim is to find which shows (chosen among movies and tv seris) were most popular on Netflix between December 2020 and March 2021.\
We did it defining a "Popularity Index" for each show based on the Top Ten ranks provided by Netflix and used it to rank the most popular shows in that period of time, and we also integrated our data with movie or tv series review on Internet Movie Database (IMDb).\
The final goal we tried to achieve was answering the urging question: "what it takes for a show to be on Netflix's top ten?".

Special thanks to @giodefa96 who worked with me on this project.
